10940,,,None,192.168.0.123,tcp,3389,Windows Terminal Services Enabled,The remote Windows host has Terminal Services enabled.,"Terminal Services allows a Windows user to remotely obtain a graphical
login (and therefore act as a local user on the remote host).

If an attacker gains a valid login and password, this service could be
used to gain further access on the remote host.  An attacker may also
use this service to mount a dictionary attack against the remote host
to try to log in remotely.

Note that RDP (the Remote Desktop Protocol) is vulnerable to
Man-in-the-middle attacks, making it easy for attackers to steal the
credentials of legitimate users by impersonating the Windows server.","Disable Terminal Services if you do not use it, and do not allow this
service to run across the Internet.",,,,,,,None,,,,20-04-2002,08-07-2020,,,

Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if
